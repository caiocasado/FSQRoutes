 This block type takes in a view controller that should be presented in some way, along with the view controller
 that is doing the presentation, and associated url data that was used to generate the presented view controller.
 It then does the actual presentation logic.
 
 E.g. A presentation block which just pushes the new view controller onto the stack might do
 ```[presentingController.navigationController pushViewController:controllerToPresent animated:YES];```
 
 @param controllerToPresent  The new controller that is to be shown on screen.
 @param presentingController The view controller doing the presentation.
 @param urlData              The url data used to generate the view controller (if any).

/**
 The Route Content class is effectively a description of the actions that should be taken when a routed url is
 actually "pushed" on screen. At its most basic this is just pushing a new view controller on the stack. 
 However when pushed or presented on screen, it can actually take any action. It also separates out the actions
 or view controllers to be generated from the logic on how to actually present them on screen.
 
 There are several different initializers based on what behavior you want to take when content is pushed:
 * `initWithViewController:` This makes a content object which wraps an already created view controller to present.
 * `initWithViewControllerClass:` This tells the content object to lazily instantiate a new VC of the given class
                                  when the content is presented.
 * `initWithBlock` This lets you specify a block which will get called when the content is presented, allowing you to
                   take any actions you wish.
