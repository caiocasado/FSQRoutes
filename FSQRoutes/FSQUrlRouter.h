/**
 The Url Router class takes in url objects that are sent to your app, matches them against a preset mapping that
 you configure at launch time, and then takes the relevant action that corresponds to that url in the map
 (usually pushing a new view controller).
 
 Your app delegate should instantiate a url router, maintain a reference to it, and register the necessary url 
 routing maps,  at startup. Then it can call `routeUrl:` for any url the app delegate receives to have it routed.
 
 Url routing has four main classes:
 * FSQUrlRouter - Does url to route string matching and delegate callbacks.
 * FSQRouteContentGenerator - Generates a route content object based on url data input.
 * FSQRouteContent - Represents an action to take for a route. Usually a view controller to be
                     presented or pushed, but can be any action at all.
 * FSQRouteUrlData - Wraps url, url parameters, and remote/local notification info into a single object.

/**
 This method lets you register a route map for a specific set of scheme names for native urls.
 
 Native urls are urls which are _not_ Universal Links (eg `yourappname://foo`).
 
 The route maps are an array of arrays. The inner arrays are shoudl be two elements, the first of which is the 
 url string to match against and the second should be a FSQRouteContentGenerator object.
 
 E.g.
 
 routeMap = @[ @[ @"/route/to/match" , [MyRoutingDelegate routeGeneratorForThisRoute] ] ,
               @[ @"/another/route"  , [MyRoutingDelegate aDifferentGenerator] ],
             ];
 
 The route map has significant ordering. If more than one route string matches a given url, the one earlier in the
 array is the one that will be the match.
 
 See README.md for a description of valid route strings.
 
 @param schemes The schemes you want to use this route map.
 @param map     The route map to be used when receiving urls with the specified schemes.
 
 @note Only one route map can be set for any one scheme. Setting a new one for the same scheme will remove the old one.
